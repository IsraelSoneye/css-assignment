                    I came into technology recently. Before this time, the best moment I enjoyed working is when I have to work from my PC.
                    Stuffs like doing online work or other internet/computer related task has been my hubby.
                    Having this opportunity to learn tech with stutern satisfied that thirst in me. 
                    I am already feeling fulfilled, even as a starter.

                    CSS is a very important tool in web development. It is used to style <em><b>html</b></em> content and makes the web page look nice to users.
                    CSS can be use to set text size and color, create web page layout, add padding, border, margin etc.
                    Using css, one can select <em><b>id, element, class</b></em> and different other properties for specific design.

                    <b>Padding:</b> Padding is the space around the text frame. It is the gap between the text area and the border.<br />
                    <b>Margin:</b>It is the space outside the border of a web page. <br />
                    <b>Border:</b> It is the frame around the text that demacates between the padding and the margin. <br />
